# Titanic_Survival_Prediction
Analyze the relationship between the demographic features of Passengers and the survival rate
Try to predict the testing dataset using decision tree model

Dataset (train.csv and test.csv): retrieved from Kaggle

1. Classifying: understand the implications of different features
2. Correlating: is there a correlation among diferent features and survival rate?
3. Converting: For modeling stage, we need to may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So, for instance, converting text categorical values to numeric values
4. Completing: data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature
5. Correcting: analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features
6. Creating: create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals
7. Charting: visualization of plots and charts depending on nature of the data
8. Modeling: choose a predicting model that has a higher confidence score, and then applying it to our testing dataset
